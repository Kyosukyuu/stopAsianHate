# Stop Asian Hate

This is a narrative-based, interactive website that is centered on the recent wave of Asian hate. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Asians have received unjustified hate, which have led to several cases of Asian hate crimes.

You will be presented with different options throughout the story, which have different outcomes.

This project was created by Kevin Zhong, Bryan Kuncahyo, and Nicolas Wong.
