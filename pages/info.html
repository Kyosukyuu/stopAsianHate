          This is a narrative-based, interactive website that is
          centered on the recent wave of Asian hate. Due to the
          COVID-19 pandemic, Asians have received unjustified hate,
          which have led to several cases of Asian hate crimes.

            This is a second-person narrative-based, interactive
            website that is centered on the recent wave of Asian hate.
            Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Asians in the United States
            have received an increased amount of unjustified hate,
            which has led to several cases of Asian hate crimes. Our
            project aims to address this particular kind of hate in a
            way that is (hopefully) more interactive and engaging than
            traditional methods.
          </p>
          <p class="lead textAnim position-relative">
            Furthermore, the main purpose of the project is for other
            people to understand Asian hate crimes from a victim's
            perspective.
